### Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway Plugin for GiveWP by CryptoPay

While CryptoPay and WordPress are rapidly expanding Web3 payments, we couldn't resist developing an integration for GiveWP, the largest donation plugin. With this integration plugin, you can now easily collect crypto donations from your WordPress site via GiveWP and CryptoPay.

Also, CryptoPay is fully developed for WordPress and supports more than 15 WordPress plugins like GiveWP (with built-in WooCommerce payment gateway)

With CryptoPay, you can receive crypto payments that are fully peer-to-peer (i.e. your customers pay directly to your wallet without any intermediary process) and commission-free (yes, absolutely zero commission).

This integration plugin will work with both the paid version and the free (CryptoPay Lite). This way, you can use the one you want according to your needs.
