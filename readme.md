### What does this plugin do?

While the crypto world is developing day by day, as BeycanPress team, we continue to integrate Blockchain and Web3 into WordPress. With CryptoPay, we paved the way for commission-free and fully peer-to-peer payments in the WordPress ecosystem and developed a CryptoPay integration to one of WordPress biggest fundraising plugins like GiveWP. With the GiveWP CryptoPay integration, you will now be able to collect crypto donations from your WordPress site.

### How does it work?

First of all, you must have either the Lite or Premium version of CryptoPay. Because this is an integration plugin. And of course you should also have the GiveWP WordPress plugin downloaded. After enabling CryptoPay, you need to go to the payment area in your GiveWP settings and add CryptoPay as a payment option. 

As you can see in the pictures, you can then start receiving crypto donations directly with GiveWP.
